            <h2>History</h2>
            <p id="p1">Rapids Rafting was founded in 1998 by John Gomez and Jess Smith, a couple who shared a passion for rafting and nature. They started with one raft and a few friends, and soon they attracted more customers who wanted to experience the thrill of the rapids. They expanded their fleet and hired more instructors, who were trained and certified by the British Canoe Union. They also partnered with local hotels and restaurants to offer packages and discounts to their clients.</p>

We have a variety of trips to suit different levels of skill and interest, from gentle to extreme. We operate on several rivers in Wales. We have a loyal customer base who come back year after year to enjoy our trips. We also welcome new customers who want to try something different and adventurous.
