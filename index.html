            <p>Hello, world! My name is Lucas Gomes Araujo. I am based in London, England, United Kingdom, have been living here for roughly a bit more than two years, and am studying for a Bachelor of Applied Science Degree in Software Development from Brigham Young University - Idaho. I got married to the love of my life in February 2022! I enjoy listening to music, playing the violin, reading books, going to the cinema, playing video games, and spending time with my family. I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints my whole life and served as a missionary in South Brazil in the Florianopolis Brazil Mission from February 2019 to December 2020.</p>
